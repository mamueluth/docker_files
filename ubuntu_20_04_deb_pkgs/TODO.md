* Cloned user seems to be in sudo group, but cannot use sudo command.
**Error:** `sudo: account validation failure, is your account locked?`
* ros2 not sourced
* ros2 commands auto completion

## todos
* Test of sharing of a working directory is a good ides an works without hassle.
 -> can be done with -v /$HOME/<path_to_workspace>:/$HOME/<workspace>:rw 
 However if building in ros and so forth is working correctly needs to be checked
* Add Controllers and compile controllers
